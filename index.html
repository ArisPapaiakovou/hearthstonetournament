        			<h3>Tournament Details</h3>
        			<p>The tournament will consist of two stages.</p>
					<p>The first stage, is a Round Robin that will be used to classify the participants for the second stage. The second stage is the Playoffs.</p>
					<h5>Round Robin Stage</h5>
						<p>In the Round Robin, every player will play one Match against every other player exactly once.
						A match consists of several game after which a match winner is declared. 
						<h6>Prerequisites for a Match</h6>
						Player must prepare four Decks of four different classes.
						Decks have restrictions, please see Deck restrictions below for more details.
						Just before the start of the Match, each player Bans one and only one deck of this choosing of the opposing players four decks.
						<h6>Start of a Match</h6>
						Since each deck is represented by a Hearthstone character each player has now 3 heros they bring forward to do battle in this Match.
						Each player chooses their starting hero deck and a normal Hearthstone game begins.
						At the end of this first game there will be a loser (Hero died) and a winner (Hero is alive).
						The player with the dead hero can no longer use him again in this match and needs to bring forward the next Hero of his choosing to continue the battle.
						The winning player continues with his hero and a new game is started.
						The match continues like so until one player has killed all three of the opponents heros and is given the win of this match.
						<h6>End of match</h6>
						After the match is ended all heros are resurrected, including the banned hero, and a match can begin with another player.</p>
					<h5>Playoffs stage</h5>	
					<p>Playoffs will use the ranking acquired from the round robin to seed the players. Say that four players participated in the round robin. First will play against the fourth, and second against the third in single elimination match format.</p>
